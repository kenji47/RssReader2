"<p>Huawei’s premier smartphone is let down by bad software</p> <p>We’re less than two months into
    2018, and so far, the year hasn’t been very good for Huawei. </p>\n<p>The Chinese company had
    hoped that this would be the year when it would finally be able to break into the US market and
    compete with Apple and Samsung. But days before it was due to make its big partnership
    announcement with AT&amp;T, the <a
            href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16865592/att-huawei-mate-10-pro-ces-deal-off\">deal
        fell apart</a> due to pressure from the US government. A rumored deal with Verizon that was
    slated for later in the year <a
            href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16950122/verizon-refuses-huawei-phone-att-espionage-cybersecurity-fears?mid=1\">reportedly
        fell apart for similar reasons</a>. Then, last week, the heads of the FBI, CIA, and NSA told
    a Senate Intelligence Committee that American citizens <a
            href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17011246/huawei-phones-safe-us-intelligence-chief-fears\">shouldn’t
        use Huawei products or services</a> on account of suspected ties to the Chinese government.
</p>\n<p>The phone that Huawei hoped would carry it into the US market is its flagship <a
        href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/16/16481242/huawei-mate-10-pro-announcement-specs-price-ai-features\">Mate
    10 Pro</a>, released in other parts of the world last fall. The Mate 10 Pro has been the focus
    of all Huawei’s marketing efforts in Western markets, from influencer partnerships to billboards
    to ad placements on popular websites (including <em>The Verge, </em>which our editorial team has
    had zero involvement in). Though Huawei lost its carrier partnerships and clearly doesn’t have
    any fans in the American government, it started selling the Mate 10 Pro unlocked in the US this
    week, and it can now be purchased for $799 from Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers.</p>\n<p>
    The Mate 10 Pro is a flagship phone with flagship specs and flagship pricing. But there are a
    lot of flagship phones with flagship specs and flagship pricing here in the US, which means that
    the Mate 10 Pro is playing in an intensely competitive field. Without a large carrier partner
    and its massive marketing budget and retail footprint, it’s not likely that the Mate 10 Pro will
    be a popular phone in the US. But it got me wondering: now that Americans can buy it, is the
    Mate 10 Pro a phone anyone should buy, regardless of what the government says? Even if Huawei
    had been able to get it on AT&amp;T or Verizon or any other US carrier, would anyone have bought
    it?</p>\n

</div>\n<p>In terms of hardware, the Mate 10 Pro has almost everything you’d expect from a flagship
    phone launched within the past six months. Its metal-and-glass body has excellent build quality,
    polished finishes, and tight tolerances. It’s water resistant. Its display has a now-fashionable
    wider 18:9 aspect ratio, with minimal bezels. It has stereo speakers and a dual rear camera
    system.</p>\n
<div>
    <aside><q>Few things are missing from the Mate 10 Pro’s spec sheet</q></aside>
</div>\n<p>Inside is Huawei’s own top-of-the-line Kirin 970 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of
    storage. There’s a huge, quick-charging 4,000mAh battery that can keep it going all day and then
    some. The phone even has an IR blaster so you can use it to control your TV or other
    electronics.</p>\n<p>Like many high-end phones, it doesn’t have a headphone jack, though Huawei
    does provide both EarPod knockoff headphones and a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box. It also
    doesn’t have wireless charging, despite the glass back.</p>\n<p>But those are fairly minor
    complaints. If there’s a hardware feature you want, the Mate 10 Pro probably has it.</p>\n

</div>\n<p>For the most part, that hardware works really well. I found the Mate 10 Pro to be as fast
    as any recent Android flagship. The hardware is nice to hold, and thanks to that enormous
    battery, it has terrific battery life. I didn’t find any obvious annoyances, like a poorly
    placed fingerprint sensor, an extra button for a voice assistant you’ll never use, or a notch
    that covers up part of the top of the screen, either.</p>\n<p>The 6-inch display has a lower
    resolution than many of its peers, at “only” 1080p, but I don’t think it’s a cause for concern,
    as both text and images are sharp. It’s OLED, which provides deep blacks and vibrant colors. It
    has excellent viewing angles and gets bright enough for use outdoors while I’m walking to the
    office. And, like a lot of newer Android phones, it has an always-on mode that will show you the
    time and date without having to pick up the phone.</p>\n<p>Perhaps my favorite feature is the
    Mate 10 Pro’s speakers, which are loud, clear, and automatically switch from mono to stereo when
    you turn the phone from portrait to landscape orientation.</p>\n

    \n
</div>\n<p>What often separates top-tier phones from the rest are the cameras, and while the
    Leica-branded dual rear camera isn’t as good as a Pixel 2 or an iPhone X camera, it’s certainly
    a capable shooter. It has fast focus and performance, preserves a good amount of detail, and
    produces pleasing, if a little bit oversaturated, colors.</p>\n
<div>
    <aside><q>The Mate 10 Pro’s camera takes lovely black-and-white images</q></aside>
</div>\n<p>The camera app has a ton of features and options, including manual controls, various
    portrait and fake blurring modes, and automatic scene functions that attempt to optimize the
    camera for whatever your subject is. Point the camera at a person, and it quickly switches to
    portrait mode; point it at a plate of food, and it switches to the food preset, and so on. It’s
    certainly easier to use than manually changing modes for each subject.</p>\n<p>My favorite
    camera mode is the monochrome option, which uses data from one of the Mate 10 Pro’s camera
    sensors to produce some of the nicest black-and-white images I’ve ever seen from a smartphone.
    Unlike the iPhone X’s studio lighting mode, it doesn’t overreach and try to duplicate a studio
    effect; it just produces nice-looking black and whites. The images are rich and contrasty, with
    lovely tones that I find hard to replicate with even my dedicated stills camera.</p>\n

    \n
</div>\n<p>But as with any phone, the hardware is only half the story, and software is generally
    what makes or breaks an experience. In the case of the Mate 10 Pro, Huawei’s software breaks
    it.</p>\n<p>The Mate 10 Pro runs Android 8.0 Oreo with Huawei’s EMUI user interface on top of
    it, and it’s wildly different from the version of Android you find on a Pixel or other modern
    phones. The best way I can describe it is a poorly made knockoff of iOS.</p>\n<p>Huawei has
    customized almost everything about Android, and often, not in a good way. For example, you can’t
    expand notifications on the lock screen, so deleting an email or marking a to-do complete can’t
    be done without unlocking the phone. The settings menu, messaging app, and share sheet have been
    lifted right out of iOS and shoehorned onto Android. For some reason, most of the apps in the
    share sheet are hidden by default, forcing extra taps and swipes just to see them all.</p>\n
<div>
    <figure>\n<img alt=\" \"

        <figcaption><em>The story of Huawei’s software is poor design mixed with iOS
            influences.</em></figcaption>
        \n
    </figure>
    \n
</div>\n<p>Sure, you can change some of these things by downloading a different launcher or
    messaging app, but you can’t change things like the quick settings menu that doesn’t match the
    rest of the notification shade or that awful share sheet. You can’t turn on an option to make
    notifications on the lock screen more useful. On top of that, there are frustrating bugs — even
    when I downloaded another launcher and attempted to use that, the Mate 10 would frequently reset
    itself to Huawei’s own launcher.</p>\n
<div>
    <aside><q>The Mate 10 Pro’s software is bad enough to prevent recommending the phone</q></aside>
</div>\n<p>This isn’t the kind of software experience anyone should have on an $800 phone,
    especially when there are already so many better options available. It’s bad enough that I
    honestly think nobody should buy the Mate 10 Pro because of its software, especially not at this
    price. You can get all of the hardware performance with none of the software headaches from any
    number of other Android phones available unlocked or through carriers.</p>\n<p>That’s just on an
    unlocked version of the phone, too. I’m curious what would have happened had Huawei been able to
    launch this phone with AT&amp;T, which inevitably would have loaded its own bloatware on top of
    it. Huawei doesn’t have the clout of Apple, Google, or even Samsung when it comes to negotiating
    with carriers, and it certainly would have had to bend to their demands for customization. (Just
    look at the <a
            href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16667508/zte-axon-m-dual-screen-smartphone-review\">ZTE
        Axon M</a>, which is exclusive to AT&amp;T and loaded with as much bloatware as AT&amp;T
    could manage to cram on it.) In this regard, having a carrier deal probably wouldn’t have made
    much of a difference for Huawei. It’s hard to see anyone buying this phone as it is right now,
    carrier support or not.</p>\n

    </figure>
    \n
</div>\n<p>I can’t deny that Huawei has done a lot right with the Mate 10 Pro’s hardware, even if it
    doesn’t necessarily break any new ground. It’s well-made, has all of the top-tier features, and
    is just as fast as any other phone in this class. If it wasn’t so expensive, I could perhaps
    excuse some of the software issues. But this is a premium-priced phone, and you should get a
    premium experience, which the Mate 10 Pro doesn’t provide.</p>\n<p>Following the collapse of
    Huawei’s deal with AT&amp;T, Richard Yu, the CEO of Huawei’s consumer products division, <a
            href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2018/1/9/16871538/huawei-ces-2018-event-ceo-richard-yu-keynote-speech\">made
        the case</a> that because the US government meddled in its business, American consumers are
    being robbed of the widest choice of smartphones that people in others parts of the world enjoy.
    He’s certainly not wrong; more choice is generally considered a good thing, as it provides more
    options for us and promotes more competition among manufacturers.</p>\n<p>But it’s hard for me
    to see anyone taking advantage of that choice even if they had it and opted to spend $800 for
    the Mate 10 Pro instead of a phone from Google, Samsung, or even Apple. If Huawei really wants
    to play in the US, it not only has to work with carriers and make the US government happy, but
    it also has to make and sell a phone that people will want to buy here — and frankly, the Mate
    10 Pro isn’t it.</p>\n
